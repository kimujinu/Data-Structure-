ONE 397
THE 9158
RIDDLE 16
HOUSE 52
villagers 4
of 3868
Little 91
Hangleron 1
still 270
called 54
it 1423
"the 118
House," 2
even 154
though 346
had 1854
been 550
many 87
years 47
since 67
family 29
lived 12
there. 29
stood 93
on 1092
a 3546
hill 5
overlooking 2
village, 5
some 183
its 164
windows 11
boarded, 1
tiles 1
missing 15
from 704
roof, 1
and 4711
ivy 2
spreading 5
unchecked 1
over 427
face. 65
Once 123
fine-looking 1
manor, 1
easily 6
largest 7
grandest 1
building 4
for 938
miles 6
around, 28
was 2682
now 267
damp, 1
derelict, 1
unoccupied. 1
Hagletons 1
all 642
agreed 9
that 1408
old 111
"creepy." 1
Half 64
century 1
ago, 13
something 148
strange 18
horrible 23
happened 45
there, 59
older 13
inhabitants 3
village 16
liked 16
to 4726
discuss 8
when 417
topics 1
gossip 1
were 867
scarce. 1
story 13
picked 29
so 384
times, 8
embroidered 2
in 2116
places, 2
nobody 36
quite 88
sure 83
what 487
truth 12
anymore. 5
Every 133
version 4
tale, 1
however, 93
started 88
same 67
place: 1
Fifty 12
before, 18

three 115
Riddles 7
dead. 10
run 21
screaming 17
down 404
into 686
roused 2
as 1335
people 128
she 769

"Lying 1

Cold 49

police 10
summoned, 2
whole 50
Hangleton 3
seethed 1
shocked 5
curiosity 4
ill-disguised 1
excitement. 7
wasted 5
breath 17
pretending 8
feel 61
very 439
sad 2
about 472
Riddles, 1
they 1015

"Frank!" 1

"Always 4
thought 169
odd," 1
told 205
eagerly 3
listening 26
villagers, 1
after 163
her 714
fourth 18
sherry. 1
"Unfriendly, 1

Never 174

"Ah, 26

grunted 3

"War 1

landlord. 1
"Told 6

an 408
excited 11
corner. 7
"Horrible 1
temper," 1
Dot, 1
nodding 8
fervently. 3
remember, 4
kid..." 1
By 343
following 29
morning, 18
hardly 22
anyone 54
doubted 7
killed 24

But 795
